# Companies Layoffs Dataset - Data Cleaning

## Introduction
📊 Exploring layoffs in the job market! This project focuses on cleaning the `Companies Layoffs` dataset to ensure high-quality data for further analysis. The dataset contains information on layoffs across various companies, including industry, location, and affected employees.

## Database Setup
- Created a PostgreSQL database and imported the dataset.
- Took a database backup to prevent data loss before performing transformations.

## Data Cleaning Process
To prepare the dataset for analysis, I performed the following data cleaning steps:

- **1️⃣ Removed Duplicates:** Ensured no duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.
- **2️⃣ Standardized Data:** Formatted column names and values for consistency.
- **3️⃣ Handled Null/Blank Values:** Replaced or removed missing values based on relevance.
- **4️⃣ Dropped Unnecessary Columns/Rows:** Removed data that was not useful for analysis.


## Next Steps
🚀 Moving forward, I will conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights about layoffs trends, affected industries, and patterns over time.

Stay tuned for the findings! 🔍📈
